### Subject
> Google Books is a project that embraces the value books bring to our daily lives. It aspires to bring the world's books online and make them accessible to everyone. In the last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books in more than 400 languages, partly by scanning books from libraries and publishers all around the world.
\
In this competition problem, we will explore the challenges of setting up a scanning process for millions of books stored in libraries around the world and having them scanned at a scanning facility.

This year, the teams had to create an algorithm to **maximise the efficiency of the process of scanning books in multiple libraries**.\
For more information (e.g.: sample inputs / expected outputs) please refer to the [subject](https://github.com/Harmos274/GoogleHashCode2020/blob/master/hashcode_2020_online_qualification_round.pdf).\

### Usage

You'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run the script.

```sh
$ python3 ./algoSort.py inputFile.txt
$ cat outputFile.txt
```
